Release identity for V1 is **local-only (R0)** — see `docs/release/versioning-policy.md`.

## [v1.1.3] — 2026-10-21 — three defects a five-line script found

Two example scripts for the language repository turned over three codegen and
packaging defects in an hour. None was visible to the suite: no test in it read a
file, exited from a conditional, or passed an argument to a program.

### Added
- **A `.tl` file is a program.** `tallow app.tl` runs it; a `#!/usr/bin/env tallow`
  shebang is accepted (the line is blanked, not stripped, so spans still index the
  original source); arguments after the path belong to the program
  (`./wc.tl notes.txt` becomes `tallow run wc.tl -- notes.txt`).

### Fixed
- **`fs.read_file` had no native plane (#138).** The "could not open" report was
  emitted from the ok block using a buffer defined in the fail block — invalid IR,
  so clang 18 died in the register coalescer and every file-reading program fell
  back to the interpreter. The report now lives on the fail path; the ok path
  compares `fread()` against `st_size` and fails loudly on a short read.
- **`exit()` inside a conditional produced invalid IR (#139).** `process.exit(n)`
  emits `unreachable`, after which the enclosing `if` appended a dead `br`.
  `emit_line` now drops a branch when the current block already ends in a
  terminator.
- **`install.sh` advertised "latest" and installed 1.1.1 (#140).** `VERSION` was a
  literal, so it requested an asset that never existed. It now resolves
  `/releases/latest` after argument parsing and exits 2 with a usable message when
  it cannot.

## [v1.1.2] — 2026-10-21 — a Result cannot be dropped

### Fixed
- **A discarded `Result` was silent success (#133).** Both planes now run the same
  rule: a `Result`-valued call whose value nobody reads, in a non-final statement
  of a block, is checked — `Err` writes to stderr and exits 1.
- **`match` on a `T?` now compiles (#134).** The payload type comes from the
  callee's signature instead of being refused.
- **Returning a computed value from a `-> T?` function was refused on the native
  plane (#135).** `coerce` now boxes any non-optional value whose slot is optional;
  unwrapping (`T?` → `T`) is still refused, because it needs a check the compiler
  cannot invent.

### Changed
- Register rows #129, #130 and #132 were re-measured rather than restated; see
  `docs/operations/stub-register.md` for the corrected premises.

## [v1.1.1] — 2026-10-10 — the deployment's fix, landed (prepared on `v1`, local-only)

v1.1 released a gate whose deployment ran a fix the release did not contain. The installed binary had been
built from the live tree plus a patch binding a **read-only open** into `sluice verify`, and that patch — the
one that makes the anchor control deployable at all — existed in no commit. The release therefore could not
reproduce the binary its own deployment depended on.

### Fixed
- **`KtLog::open_read_only` is in the tree.** `verify` and `verify_segment_close` take a read handle on the
  receipt log instead of a write handle, so the account that checks the log is no longer an account that can
  rewrite it.

### Known gap, recorded rather than hidden
- The running deployment still describes its binary as built from a live patched tree, so it is not yet
  reproducible from a revision. Re-deploying from this tag closes that, and the deployment-provenance gate
  is the mechanism that will say so.

## [v1.1] — 2026-10-10 — the cross-domain release gate (prepared on `v1`, local-only)

Adds **Sluice**, a cross-domain release gate: one decision over whether material may cross a domain
boundary, with failures attributed to the BOUNDARY MODEL rather than to the material. Cross-domain transfer
failures are failures of the boundary, not of what is being transferred.

### The gate
- **Stage order is frozen**: plan+lineage → channel admit → channel obligations → class gate → caveat gate
  → release+receipt. `exit 0` = ALLOW, `exit 1` = DENY.
- **14 emittable deny codes**, each with a stable machine-readable form so a caller can tell a boundary
  refusal from an infrastructure failure.
- **Receipts are digest-only** and hash-chained into the existing KT log — no sidecar, no plaintext.
- **CLI**: `check` / `channels` / `explain` / `release` / `verify` / `rotate`.

### Verification
- A **30-gate regression battery** (`tools/regression_gates.sh`) runs over both the deliverable and the
  product: a clean-checkout build gate, a deployment-drift gate, and auditors that re-derive every count,
  citation and path the documents state rather than trusting them.
- **124 defects** found and recorded across 45 waves, each with its reproduction and severity.

### Deployment
- Installed and running on the reference host: daily rotation, hourly divergence monitoring, hourly anchor
  recording. Each is proven by a real run, not by its unit being enabled.

### Release identity
- Tag `v1.1` pairs with Cargo version `1.1.0`. Release identity remains **local-only (R0)** per R-03.
- This entry covers the gate and its verification. Other work on the `v1` line between the freeze and this
  tag is recorded in the commit history rather than summarised here.

## [v1.0] — 2026-09-14 — V1 freeze (prepared on `v1`, local-only)

The first V1 freeze candidate, assembled through the R-08 execution program
(batches 1–4) on branch `v1` (17 checkpoint commits B0–B16, tip `fea1029`),
verified by batteries 2–9. Not a public release; tag + archive mechanics per
`docs/release/` and decision R-03/D6.

### Identity fabric (W3)
- **SVID workload identity** — certs, issuer, relay mutual-auth, zero-trust policy
  pack (`W7201–W7203`), short-lived scope-bound workload tokens, sector pseudonyms.
- **Enrollment ceremony** — two-sided SAS-based enrollment with single-use
  SPKI-bound tokens and honest attestation (`src/enrollment.rs`, `pake/sas.rs`).
- **Revocation** — signed revocation lists with TTL-bounded staleness, checked at
  the daemon handshake seam (refuse new sessions; established sessions
  untouched per D-4); KT-logged.
- **Recovery** — offline custody shares (Shamir, k≥2 distinct custodians),
  dual-control recovery with root-commitment verification, root-rotation
  ceremony (Ed25519 approvals, no self-approval, re-verify-at-execute,
  retired roots never re-anchored); honest-unrecoverable doctrine; KT-logged.
- **Persona firewall** — enforcement layer with typed findings/refusals.

### Key transparency
- Append-only BLAKE3 KT log with signed tree heads, inclusion and consistency
  proofs; event payloads committed by hash (caller-held evidence). Wired into
  enrollment, recovery and revocation flows.

### Config kernel
- Layered scopes (KB-2), versioning/migrations (KB-3), signed config bundles
  (Ed25519; verify-before-load), secure-by-default lint pack.

### Crypto & supply chain
- AEAD upgrades (agent channel v2; CredentialVault), Argon2id single-source
  parameters, AEGIS gating, constant-time test harness + procurement rule,
  cargo-vet trust foundation, SBOM/CBOM drift gates.

### Transport, egress, measurement
- TallowTransfer relay end-to-end + delta-sync resume; transport fallback and
  bandwidth limits; fail-closed Tor egress (direct is an explicit opt-in);
  browser/measurement readiness for the D4 calibration run.

### Compliance
- Compliance report generator with CRA 24h / CERT-In 6h early-warning clocks
  and ZNISM self-assessment output.

### Gates & process
- `release_gate.sh` acceptance battery (`--twice`, `--quick`, evidence archive),
  `never_check.sh` (static + cargo + optional live egress), `kev_gate.sh`,
  claims-ledger gate; freeze chain F-01…F-08 defined.

### Known limitations (honest, per freeze review)
- Live calibration run **R-01** pending (windows A/B); cost/perf multipliers stay
  `[target-only]` until then.
- SLIP-39 mnemonic leg blocked (no offline crate/wordlist) — recorded, not built;
  FROST k-of-n authorizer dep-gated; mesh/swarm legs are W5 by design.
- Release identity is local-only (no remote, no CI execution); non-Linux targets
  not exercised on this host.
